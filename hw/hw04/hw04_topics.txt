1. Various Pandas manipulations
2. Datetime practice
3. Practice smoothing techniques: Additive Smoothing,
4. Practice smoothing techniques: Rolling Windows
5.  Visualization question for practice (maybe two, plotting is tricky)

6.  Outlier/Null Imputation (DONE)
	- plain dataset, or even just a description of one or a few (mimic midterm)
	- make them choose MAR/MCAR/NMAR
	- make them choose "any valid statement" about missingness, among
    a selection.
7. Rolling windows and datetime (use SDPD clean data(?); datetime
questions) (DONE)
8. conditional additive smoothing. (DONE)
	- added a plotting part of question
	- need to update the (skipped) lecture notes; different formula
9. SDPD (start with clean dataset): Null imputation implications (deal
with MAR) (DONE)
10. A join using time-deltas; analysis of what didn't join.


pretty relevant: may use its ideas to cut some corners:
