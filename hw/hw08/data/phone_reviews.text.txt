works great  i called t mobile and had this sim card activated in 5 minutes  they have a automated system or you can speak to a rep
these items looked to be of good quality and have lasted several months so far  i am satisfied with the purchase  considering the low cost
this product arrive faster than i expected  i love how it looks and feel  the price is pretty cheap  will def  order it again but in different colors
i brought this for my sister who has a g2 but not sure how it works yet  will let you know as soon as you update me updateit was too small  for  her  phone   per  the  description  should  fit her t  mobile galaxy but it  didn't  i  didn't  bother to  mail it back
i am both delighted and disappointed with dell venue pro  windows phone is the operating system of my choice primarily due to its productivity  venue pro is very much businesslike  precisely the type of mobile phone i want  however  the terrible power management makes it virtually unbearable to me let me give my ratings below first  on a scale of 10  with numbers in the parenthesis for iphone 4 as a reference  thermal performance   2  8 battery life   2  7 build quality  9  9 5 screen quality  9 5  9 5   processor   meaningless comparison  but see  speed and efficiency  os reliability   9 9  9 5 os fluency   9 5  9 0 os feature depth   6  9 os flexibility customization   5  8 os app ecosystem   5  9 5 productivity   9  5 form factor and appearance   completely subjectiveentertainment  9  9 speed and efficiency  9  7   yes the retina screen of iphone 4 has higher resolution  but the screen of venue pro looks slightly better under sunlight  in practice it's a wash as you can see above  venue pro even manages to beat iphone 4 in the few very important areas  but at the end of the day  it's just such a miserable device   the venue pro is otherwise a very capable phone  but the power management which includes thermal performance and battery life is so terrible  it really deserves a failing grade   a pity  because this phone with windows 7 5 would have been a quite attractive device the power management deserving of flunking gradefirst  it runs very warm in your hands  quite uncomfortable after just a few minutes of running a few apps  some email checking or web browsing  this is not only uncomfortable  but could actually be even a health concern  i know what heat and radiation of a mobile device can do to human body  my hands got a slowly burnt condition as a result of  longtime use of windows tablet computers  with venue pro  the thermal problem is so seriously bad that the issue alone makes it an extremely undesirable phone second  the battery life is miserable  not really surprising given the bad heat problem  this phone will not last a day  unless you don't use it at all   it can support only about 2 hours of continuous use  many times whorse than my laptop  it has just a bit over 24 hours of standby time even if you don't use it at all  again  many times worse than my laptop    any modestly use  for example  very modest amount of browsing and e mailing plus a few short calls  will exhaust the battery of this phone before the end of the day  i am not a heavy mobile user  and still i usually end up having to charge it at least once a day  when i'm out on a trip  twice or more a day  making it among the biggest mental burdens while you're traveling  simply not worth it  this is absolutely the worst battery performance among the many phones i have used or and handled   to me   this is simply unacceptable  it may be too much to ask for a phone that last for a week  especially with the smart phones becoming almost full featured computers  but failing to last even a single day is too much of a shortcoming mixed bag with the wp 7 5 osi love and hate windows phone os  the user interface is very intuitive  glitch free and just so smooth  which is every bit as good as ios  but much better than android    the best of all  however  is that windows phone os is the most productive smart phone os among the major platforms  if you are a content consumer  all three mobile platforms are shoulder to shoulder  but if you are a content creator  windows phone is far ahead  the iphone and android cannot match the power of microsoft's office 365 which integrates with microsoft phone perfectly   if you or your company subscribe to office 365 and use the cloud versions of the outlook  teamsite and sharepoint  the microsoft phone can do almost anything you can do using a laptop  although with certain limitations on the small user interface  even if you don't use office 365  getting the free windows live and skydive  which is very much underrated  would already be an excellent productive user experience another potentially killer app on wp is the just released skype  still beta  but very usable   if you use skype pro or skype out  you can actually make phone calls anywhere in the world as long as you have wi fi connection  no cellular connection is required  i was on an international trip the other day  and it came extremely handy  i was able to make calls back to home and work at the airports even though i did not have a sim card for the local service  even after i got a temporary local sim card  i continued to use skype on my windows phone to make calls using the 3g data service on the card  because it costs only two cents a minute  less than 1 20 of the cost for international calls made on that type of sim card   this is potentially a huge differentiator for windows phones  i hope microsoft can make the point clear for users   because they own skype  they could make it exclusive  if doing that helps to make windows phone a success  i am all for it  because i'd hate to see windows phone fail  i need something different from iphone or android for my lifestyle but the wp7 5 os is not fully cooked yet even with the latest mango update  the depth of customization is just not there just to name a few  1  you can't turn off that stupid screen auto rotation  you simply can't so far  no user settings has that  no app that does that  even unlocked phone can't do that  forgive me to call auto rotation feature stupid  but it is one of those tech things that made no sense on a mobile phone  precisely because a mobile phone is just so  mobile  the problem is that these device designers fail to understand that the proper  or desired  orientation of the screen simply cannot be determined by an orientation sensor  it is not a mechanical problem  it is a human problem  even if they were so sure that they could decide what the user desires based on a sensor reading  they still fail to understand that it is the relative positions of both the phone and the user's body posture that are more relevant  not the position of the phone itself  a mobile phone can be in many different positions in relation to the user's body position  and a single sensor is not capable to determine such relative positions  the current sensor can only detect the phone's orientation itself  not its relative position to the user's body posture   in practice  the autorotation causes much more annoyance than any utility  it is ok if they just want to use it as a gimmick to attract shallow feature counters  but it is not ok to have it permanently implemented and cannot be turned off  it's simply stupid actually  the reason why i make this auto rotation issue such a big deal is just to make a point  not because the thing itself is so life threatening  i can live with the annoyance  but the failure or overlook of such issues is very telling of the level of ergonomics the maker of this phone understands or is willing to make an effort to  2  you can't edit the individual fields of in a contact profile  and the given choices such as  mobile    home    home 2  are simply too rigid to satisfy even quite ordinary needs  3  copy and paste is still an issue  although works quite well within the same application  it does not work very reliably  across applications  it works across some applications but not others those are just several among many small details  microsoft has done the hard part of building a very promising mobile os  why is it so difficult for them to do these very basic and simple things right  it is obviously not an engineering issue   it is a product management issue  it is a company culture issue  microsoft's level of paying attention to details can't match that of ios  while its level of geekness can't match of that of android  so at the end it loses on both sides  perhaps wp really is meant for low level entry users  but with dell venue pro  we are talking about a business mobile phone here mixed bag with the hardwarethe hardware of dell venue pro is a mixed bag as well  in addition to the power management issue which is downright terrible  this phone is a little bit too bulky  particularly too thick  the thickness is partly a result of including a hard button keyboard  which i thought would be almost a necessity for someone like me  but turned out to be almost superfluous  ironically because the soft keyboard is extremely good and even has some significant advantages over the hard keyboard due to its programed flexibility and extensions   i personally think the soft keyboard of venue pro is even better than that of iphone 4  which itself is excellent  there are other details which dell failed to pay attention to  for example  the hard keyboard keys are illuminated  which is good  but the illumination does not turn on at the desired time  it does sometimes  but usually off when you actually needed  have no idea what they were thinking  clearly  neither microsoft nor dell is apple when it comes to paying attention to user experience details otherwise  the hardware is fine  the screen is beautiful  the iphone 4's retina screen may sound better in the specification  but in practice you really don't see any difference  both are extremely good  and the dell screen is actually better under the sunlight  the build quality is very high  although it uses a chipset and processor from three years ago  the phone is not slow in any measure  there simply isn't a problem in this aspect of all  i haven't compared it with iphone 4s  but the venue pro is actually faster than iphone 4  even though the latter uses a more powerful processor  this is a testament to the efficiency of microsoft phone os in summary  i don't recommend this phone  if one is interested in mobile productivity  microsoft phone is the platform to go  but this is not it  one should wait until microsoft phone 8 0  apollo  is put on a top of line nokia lumia
of all the protectors i had seen for the nexus 4  this was the only nice looking one i could find that had a protector for the back of the phone  which is glass   this cover snaps on securely  yet is still easy to remove if pried the correct way   i have fumbled the phone a couple of times and the bumper has kept it completely safe   while i hate covering up the back   34 prism  34  glass on this phone  i would rather it be kept safe   with this and a halo screen protector  i have the phone fairly well covered in protection drawback   only one   due to the way the plastic protrudes over the buttons  sticking out somewhat from the bumper  they are often pressed accidentally   a minor complaint  but it is a little too easy to press them   for the protection given  i'll live with the trade off
this screen protector is great for protection  ex  dropping it on gravel   the only cons i don't care for is the sticky feeling of the screen due to it being a soft screen protector  i also don't like the fact that the screen protector seems to have ripples all over it which is unnoticeable while the screen is on
i bought this for my boyfriends birthday present after seeing his best friend with one  and this little jambox has been the answer to all of our portable music problems  it's tiny but man does it pack a punch  it has a good bass to it too  and that is impressive  it takes a few times to get the hang of how it works especially if you have two people connected to it but we got it down  the battery even lasts about 4 6 hours on constant play which again is impressive  we love love love this thing
this iphone case is truly awesome  besides actually protecting the back and the screen of the phone  it has a metal kick stand attached to the back that i have not yet figured out how to use properly
my wife uses her phone quit a bit all day and night  she gets almost two days from this battery  would buy again if needed
very nice little item   stands out in your purse   it really is a generic clamshell with a little net  luggage holder  like the net on the back of a car trunk to hold your item in place  i use it for ear bud earphones   makes a cute little gift too   the cable tie is worthless  but no matter  not really needed with the little round case
gets the job done  i dont use it everyday  its more of an assessory to camofauge my mobile phone  durible enough to withstand multiple dropps or falls  will purchase this brand again if needed
i bought this cover after using the samsung flip cover  i have an i stand  inc  sport model cell phone holder for the car and couldn't see my screen  now with this cover  my phone is protected and i can view the screen  it's also not bulky like an otter box  so i love it
really awesome product  not bulky like some other screen protectors  doesn't affect typing or the viewing of things on the screen
i have tried the various 3m screen protectors and this one is great  hides your screen from others so you can view your data securely  i am not enamored with the cardboard applicator but it seems to do the trick  if you want the feel of glass  this is not the protector for you  however  if you want privacy  this is it
i received my case today  i am skeptical of its performance  i have otter box cases for my other electronics so when i ordered this case i was expecting the same quality material as the otter box but less weight  for the price i was expecting something more durable  once i put the case on as instructed i tried to make a phone call and i realized that the sound was low too none  i had to mess around with the case and the buttons on the phone to get it to adjust so i can hear it  then i tried to plug in my head phones and i realized i can not use them without the headphone adapter  i am kind of scared to even put the case with my phone in water  even though it passed the water test without the phone  i am still scared  otter box spoiled me  i am expecting this lifeproof case to give me the same performance of a tank  like the otter box  i thought i would give this case a try to see if it stands up to its claims
the price can not be beat on this product  for anyone with a tablet these work perfectly and best part is because of the price you are never worried about losing one
i had this smartphone for about 2 months  and it is a great android os  it is the latest os so far at 2 2  and as matter of fact  some smartphones in the verizon and att networks are still running 2 1  so you'd be running a top of the line os battery life is great lasting all day long if you install one of the battery management apps such as  battery saver  and set it to turn off unused apps every 1 or 2 minutes  in my opinion this is the best app for the task  just make sure you set the right apps to be stopped  nothing worthwhile is easy the screen is bright and websites look beautiful  the only problem i have with this smartphone as well with any other touchscreen  including  er  iphone  is that the touchscreen keyboard sucks  it doesn't matter what people say  it is not easy to use a touchscreen keyboard  and it takes a big chunk of the screen  so  i'm letting this smartphone go  and i will get the samsung intercept which has a slide out keyboard  the way nature intended with real keys even though it doesn't have a dedicated graphics processor  i don't care  since i don't play video games much one thing i forgot is that the optimus v plays videogames fluidly  including angry birds and racing games  but playing video games on a touchscreen is not the way nature intended  buy a psp for that  later
good sound a very good price looks good to and is comfortable in the ear so what more can i say
work well with seniors who do not have good tactile fingers or large fingers on a ipad mini   price is great
i bought red  blue and black  the black is my favorite  they do help protect the phone  and for the price these are really good cases  all the ports and holes are were they should be  i also like that they are tpu and not silicon because silicon starts to stretch after awhile  i also like having cases with stands because i like to watch a lot of media and these fit the bill  i also bought some more higher end cases like incipio  uag  and seidio active  etc
this is the same charger that came with the razr v3 phone   light  compact  charges the phone
i purchased this in hope the reviews that said it glowed were correct  unfortunately they were not  i tried editing my settings but nothing worked
this is a great item for the price i paid for it  highly recommend it but if it gets just a lil wet u can wrap it up because it's over with
tips appear on stylus too large for galaxys3 disappointed  items also appear to be much more costly then they were last
i have tried several  and failed  other bt head phones  both more and less expensive  and until now it's been bad   these sound great and have an incredible range  i use an iphone    they are very comfortable and come with additional ear pieces to fit any ears   the block outside noise wonderfully   they also work well when talking on the phone  people i have talked to say they sound normal  i haven't used them outside  so i don't know how well the cancel wind noise and such
came with charger  extra battery  and i holster that you can charge a battery in was able to charge two batteries at once due to having two shargers and this geeat for a phone with little battery life
i've tried this with many galsxy s3 phones and nothing it won't even charge my phone when i have the chargerin it      and the day i opened it there was something shaking inside the little white square  very bad buy and very disappointed
overall i like this case   it offers decent coverage and protection for such a slim profile   on the same note  i don't think it would hold up well to drops from waist height or higher   but for everyday bumps and scratches  it suffices   i did notice it is a bit slippery   the buttons are nice and tactile  albeit the power button is a touch sensitive  especially when removing from the pocket  i always seem to hit it when taking the phone out   i use this case when i'm not using my primary uag case   i have several different usb charging data cables and haven't run into any fitment problems   every set of corded earbuds i have fit the port for the headphone jack
i bought this case for a brother ds 600 mobile scanner as it was advertised to fit that scanner   however  upon receipt i could not fit the scanner into the case as it is about 1 2 inch too short   it is a good quality case  well made and sturdy but they advertise that it will scanners that it clearly can not
i purchased this product to protect my fianc eacute 's phone and it has been worth every penny  he absolutely loves the protector
my daughter loved this case   it blends in well with her zebra room   she has a galaxy s iii and loves all the colors
so i bought this considering it had decent reviews  the quality is very poor  the glass separates from the screen and i have to push it down to  reseat  it  low quality adhesive  who knows  also it does not come with the mesh that goes behind the ear piece speaker  so if you look at the front of your phone it looks not oem  also my screen is darker in the center  i noticed this when using the camera and on certain apps  so the outside of the screen is light while about the size of a quarter in the center is darker  very annoying  i hope the seller see's this and tries to make it right be warnedbuy another screen  this one is cheap quality and not worth your money
extremely fragile   cheap materials do not buy   i cannot put it back together   i am glad i did not mess up my iphone
i really like this pen   i have more expensive styli  but this in my go to option   well worth the money
the zebra wood case for my samsung galaxy 4 is absolutely gorgeous   it is very rich looking  and i have had many compliments on it from people of both genders   i am so happy with my purchase
this is a great generic charger from amazon basics   similar products go for twice as much   buy this one if you want to save some hard earned coin
i love this case  i bought it in different colors  protect my phone well  great gift to give to friends
my kids go through cables like they are candy so i always go for cheap   they go through cheap ones just as fast as expensive ones   for some reason cables don't work well when they are slept with or worn in pockets or kept in backpacks and purses  anyway  they lasted a week or two with my kids  but the ones i claimed are still going strong  take care of them and they work fine  the image shows a   34 gift  34     we didn't get a gift  but we did get the cables and they are pretty and work well enough
i bought this case for my friend and he absolutely loved it it gave his iphone a new lookgreat product
good quality  perfect case  you can put 3 cards and has a space for bills  i hope that last a while
amazed at how easy it was to apply the screen protector  great product  very pleased and will purchase this brand for all of my cell phones
not worth buying  can't read screen when sun is out  good only when inside and at night  will not recommend
i saw video where car runs over this case and the phone is still good   i dropped my phone from my lap to the tiled floor and cracks my screen   also  the rubber part of the case goes soft and squishy after one year of use  it doesn't align with the home button anymore worst  otterbox wouldn't be responsible for fixing your phone if it couldn't protect your phone due to natural damage 3x the price as other case  i would expect more  3x more
this fits my s3 mini like a glove   would recommend to my friends   great price too and i bought it when i couldn't get one from the manufacturer website of my cell
so far i will give it 5 stars   it charges as fast at my wall outlet and seems to be durable   i have already suggested this to two other friends who have purchased it
it's fashionable and sleek  love it on the black iphone  not sure how it would hold up in a drop   no complaints
i have owned the iphone 3gs and now the iphone 4  between the 2 i have purchased 3 different cases for the iphone 3gs and this is my second case for the iphone 4  i also have the apple bumper   the cost of the various cases i have bought have ranged from  20  50  here is my basic impression of how the sonix case stacks up 1  build quality  this is a very thin and lightweight case  if you want a case that will protect your phone from drops  the apple bumper may be a better choice  in fact i did drop the phone with the bumper and there were no scratches  zero  haven't had an accident with this one  but it's a nice quality case  with a very nice grip but it's main function is to protect the phone from nicks and bruises in daily use  i have switched to using this as my default case 2  design  this is the best 'looking' case i have ever owned  it is very slim and light and compliments the iphone 4 beautifully  whereas with the apple bumper you completely lose the metal looks of this band  this one keeps enough highlights of the aluminium band that the phone does not lose any of its attractiveness  with any other phone i would not care about cloaking the phone in a case  but the iphone 4 is a thing of beauty  you just need to see it and hold it to know what i mean  this case is unique because it does not change either the balance or the looks of the phone  it compliments it very well 3  impact on antenna issue  frankly i have had no dropped calls with my iphone 4  it is better than my iphone 3gs in very way in terms of call quality  in fact i was in the outer banks recently and  while my wife sony ericsson c902 phone had a hard time keeping a signal for a call  the iphone 4 had no issues  i do have the issue where the bars will drop when you hold the phone a certain way  but it has no impact on my call quality  this case  like the bumper helps in not dropping the bars compared to holding the phone  but it does not help or degrade the call quality  so  if you are looking to get this case to help with call quality i am afraid my experience in both the washington dc area and the outer banks and places in between says it won't help or hurt   4  value  at  19 99 this is a no brainer really  you get the best looking case that is very functional and elegant  i don't really use the screen protector  the screen on the iphone 4 is already pretty glare resistant    more so than the 3gs  so the screen protector can help with scratches but not for glare  for what it's worth i used my iphone 4 as a gps for our trip to the outer banks  the screen on the iphone 4 was completely readable even in the brightest and direct sun light  the screen on the iphone 4 is fantastic and covering it up with a protector doesn't seem like a good idea  to me at least  overall  i am really happy with this case and would recommend it to anyone
i thought this was going to be a great thing for me and the girlfriend but they would not stay on and they would just come on and shut off when ever they wanted   look somewhere els for this
this screen protector is one of the best i have used   it is a very exact fit  so it is important to get it lined up accurately   i installed my first one on my iphone 4s  then received my slide on case  which was a little tight and caused the screen protector to curl    not the screen protectors fault  i used a second protector and made sure to line it up exactly   using the credit card to smooth as you go works wonders   my slide on case went on without a problem  and my screen is clear and bubble free   i have no rainbow effect or other issues   just a note    i did not remove the original plastic screen cover that came with the phone until i had these in my possession    so my screen has never seen dust or fingerprints
this was a total waste  it will not fit my jeep dash at all and even my girlfriends hhr the bottom screw hits the volume button waste of cash
cable does the job and i only bought it as a cheap alternative to the overly pricey manufacturer brand name cables   occasionally does not work properly when charging the iphone  just unplug and replug return to working order
i firmly admit that i am anti selfies  they're a necessary evil  unfortunately that are abused by too many  i do have to reconcile this with the fact that i like using my iphone to take photos  enter the iluv selfy case  the case itself is pretty solid and feels like it could take a few drops without damaging the phone  sizewise  it's not too big and i don't mind it in my pocket the camera shutter is genius  it's done over bluetooth and works just fine  this way  you can use the rear iphone camera  the one with the better lens  and properly set up your shot and run into frame  as opposed to using the front camera with less resolution   it's definitely helped out when i've set up the camera on longer exposures  shaky hands   shaky photos  overall this is a pretty decent case  if you find yourself taking lots of photos  this might be a no brainer  the price is decent for a multi function case and the fact that it integrates well into their car bike mounts is an added plus
fits great  easy to install  all of the ports line up nicely   i did not experience any strong odor that other reviewers have mentioned  the only minor con is there is no access to the microsd card  but if you upgraded to a larger capacity card you shouldn't need to take it out too often and the case is easy enough to remove
i purchased this so that i wouldn't have to search for my ringing phone or keep looking down while trying to see my telenav directions on my phone   my windshield is too deep and my sight too bad to allow me to stick the device to it so i took a few weeks before committing to mounting this permanently to my dashboard   when i did a whole new world opened up to me   i put my phone in it and my ipod and enjoy the accessibility i now have   it's a great product
perfect snug fit on my iphone 4  would've given it a 5 star but the lens for cam and flash were not aligned  but other than that it looks nice on phone
i was so happy to receive my beloved motorola h730 bluetooth headset about 3 wks ago  only to be disappointed and have my bubble burst   i read the reviews good and bad  weighed that odds and decided to ignore the complaints about the headset dying within 2 wks of purchase   i threw away the packaging and guess what   my bluetooth stopped working   ugh     now  i'm stuck with a  52 dud   thanks for nothing
i love that i can be hands free  including the connection as long as the device is powered on   just be careful  i left it on one evening  my phone rang  and apparently i was close enough to the car for it to connect     turning it off each night will solve that problem
the case is serviceable  but feels a bit loose  the same is true of other silicone rubber cases i've received from different sellers  i like it's old school feel  was inexpensive enough that i'll use it from time to time just for the fun of it  which fits why i bought it
i am grateful to be able to try this out for such an affordable price  but i have to give one star because i could not get it to work at all  using samsung galaxy nexus and samsung smart tv  i bought the unit because i travel a lot and i wanted to use something for my hotel stays  i wish the device had come with some kind of instructions or support  i have tried everything posted on these reviews to no avail  good luck  it would be an awesome price if it works for you
nokia arrive really soon   the item was old and had been returned by someone   it's my fault i should have check the photos for a couple of times before buying   not totally crazy with nokia lumia 900 afterall i've seen it   i did returned it and it was easy an smooth seller and amazon respond as soon as i wrote them about it
just like they advertise you can use this blue tooth to make calls and music comes through smoothy and has a wonderful sound
thank you for the qucik service after droppingmy ipad 2 i thought it was gone a few parts from amazon and all better not the easiest thing i have ever done  but more fun that a puzzel sevcie was great and shipent was ontime many tnaks
i really like the features and the call quality of this headset  when i've asked people i'm talking to they cannot tell that i'm using a headset  and my end is always nice and clear  i like that it tells you how much charge is left in the battery when you turn it on  and that it uses the same micro usb connector as my phone does  so i can pretty much charge it anywhere  battery life is really good too  i've had it for about a month and have only had to charge it once    granted  i don't live on my phone and really only use it when i'm in the car  but that's still good battery life  it also reads text messages and streams music from my phone  that's pretty neat too on the down side  the rubber ear piece that is included  and there's only one  hurt my ears  luckily it takes a standard size earpiece and i was able to get an assortment of different sizes for 99 cents from a different vendor  now i don't even need the ear hook
this is a great battery   the sizing is just right for portability  about the size of a small external drive  but has so much juice it seems to go on forever   it takes a while to charge so do it overnight but it is a fantastic battery   got it for  30 on sale at amazon at that price it is 5 stars for sure
i got this for my htc inspire had this phone for quite some time and it works good and the protector is good
this is a flimsy rubber car mount for iphone 5  designed to adhere to the center console cons 1   the holder is designed so that  it holds the phone only in landscape mode 2   the phone sits almost vertically  with very little  non adjustable tilt to it so that it can't be really be seen very well  from a console mount position3   the phone slips loosely into rubbery grooves that do not hold it too securely pros 1   it was cheap enough   6 99  not the price listed on this page     to throw away and not feel badly about it one of my worst ever amazon purchases
overall this does exactly what it intends to do  it charges my iphone 5 and the coiled cord prevents tangles or knots  the only drawback is that the cord is not very long  this may be fine if you are keeping your ios device near the charger  but if you plan on using your ipad or iphone while it's charging you will have to stretch the cord  i could see this being more of an issue for anyone with a dashboard dock for their iphone on a larger car like an suv  i have a vw jetta with a dashboard dock and the cord stays stays plugged into the phone  but the cord does have a fair amount of tension           i received this product for free as part of the amazon com vine program  nonetheless  i review the product in the same manner as i would if i had purchased it myself
very glad to be able to buy this my grand daughter is 13 but is rough on her phone  trying to avoid breaking the screen
i hate the fact that i spend a fortune for an iphone and still need a case  but i went without for about a week and  of course  dropped it  one corner of the metal part of the phone popped out of the banana yellow body  and it took me all day to get it to pop back in  this belkin case is mostly translucent  so the nice color still shows through  and it has a nice textured grip  it really does protect the corners and edges  though it does add a little bulk  as all cases seem to do  the buttons are handled with little clear buttons that are part of the case  sitting on top of the phone's actual buttons  and they work really well  there are the usual openings for the switch that silences the phone  the plugs for charging and earbuds  and the camera  the purple stripe looks good with my yellow  and so far my mom hasn't noticed it  so i haven't heard any comments about lsu  if i have to have a case  and i do  it may as well be this one
this is a hight quality charger it last a fair good amount of time also charges the phone in and hour good product
i was surprised to find a case for the evo 4g at such a great price   i had considered the innocase from seidio  but felt it was high priced   i took a chance on getting this inexpensive case and the gamble payed off   this case was very well thought out  offering additional padding where it's needed during a fall   the back of the case makes a recessed enclosure for the camera and kick stand i purchased the black one as i am not a fan of various colors   the case doesn't add much bulk to the device   the device is already big  so you don't even notice   you'd be happy knowing your device is protected during a fall   nothing worse than your phone hitting the cement unprotected
this is what you need if you want to charge your ipad in the car  it won't charge with a regular usb port
love this case  nothing matches up to otter boxes  i wish the back pink real tree print was a bit more like the one for the iphone though  the iphone is more like a print on the actual case while this one feels more like a sticker attached  i'm worried about cleaning it  i'm afraid i might mess up the case  other than that love it
this is fabulous but be carful because it looks real and unless you know the people you are with it could easily attract the wrong crowd because they are gonna think that you are balling lol
works well but slow to charge  took hrs to charge  but for the price i really cant complain  i use it as a second battery backup so time doesn't concern me
funny how apple cannot afford to include the tool necessary to open the sim tray     well  if you purchased an iphone and find that you need to open the sim tray  you can either try to bend a paperclip and try to get it in straight  or you can order this tool   personally  i found this tool to work much better i was a bit surprised to find that three tools were included in the shipment instead of the one described   so  i am more than pleased with this order   the tool works great and because of the shape  it goes in straight and opens the tray with ease having three of them makes it less likely to lose the tool   this way i can keep one at home with the paperwork  take one on trips overseas  cheaper to buy prepaid chips at the airports  and have one more put away the tool arrived on time and it works great    i would highly recommend the tool and the vendor
dropped the phone once and the so called   34 dual layer protection  34  failed   entire front of the screen is shattered even though it fell case side down   kind of disappointing that it didn't offer any type of protection on the fall   i've had other cases that have protected the phone from falls much better
i really hated having cords all over in my car  got this and it work but the port is a bit loose when connected  as long as i do not bump my phone it will charge and works great  just wish the connection was a bit better
i love otterbox and i've been using defender cases for 4 years   the 9900 9930 defender is designed wrong   people posting positive reviews most likey have not used the case yet  when you first assemble case on 9930  it feels and looks great   as soon as you try snapping it into the holster  you start wondering why did that takes so much effort   then when try to pull the phone back out of holster  it feels like you're going to break the phone from all the force it takes to get it out then you'll see that the rubber part is coming off and needs to be pushed back on every time the phone comes out   then you'll call otterbox  they will send you the same identical replacement piece that still comes off then you'll need to go spend another  50 on a seidio case   so skip the otterbox step and save some money   i haven't actually bought the seidio case yet because i'm not sure they all have the sleep magnet yet
this little product doesn't look like it will work  but it does and its pretty cool  it's not as loud as speakers but it definitely amplifies my music
does  not  work with samsung galaxy 2    sprint's  doesn't fit  have to cut it with scissors and still doesn't really fit
i got this in a timely fashion and i am very satisfied  it has a good grip an it's a nice fit
i love thyis case it is very soft material so you won't scratch your phone and fits like a glove along with the belt hook it also has belt loops so you have extra security of the pouch not falling off wonderful
the new trent arcadia click pen stylus is a very well designed and solid stylus  i prefer the microfiber tip to the rubber ball as seen on other stylus  i always have a fear that the rubber ball will fall off and scratch my screen  i do not have that fear with the microfiber tips in the new trent stylus  the retractable feature is one of the best features i like because it keeps the tip protected when i have the stylus buried in a computer bag  the clip also comes in handy for clipping the stylus to a pocket  the stylus is very responsive on both my htc phone and galaxy tablet  the only improvement that could be made to this stylus is if it was designed with tip similar to a samsung s pen  more of a pencil like tip
as a screen protector this is okay but not great   i was really excited about the 'mirror' aspect of this cover but i guess i'm in the minority with regards to how mirror like this cover actually is   yes  you can see your reflection but i wouldn't say it's remotely close to an actual mirror like surface   the reflection is more of what you might see looking into a well polished piece of dark glass   the reflected image isn't distorted  which is good   but the reflection lacks brightness and color like you would expect from a mirror  if that makes sense when the back light is lit  the mirrored surface does 'disappear' and is not obtrusive to viewing your ipod display in any way that i found noticeable   as for value  you do receive two of these covers  at least i did  so if you mess up the application the first time you get a second go at it  or  gift it hold on to it use it if you have multiple ipods in the house   application was super easy and i didn't have any problems getting air bubbles out from under the screen i hate to sound so wasteful but the mirrored surface didn't do anything for me and by the end of the day i found that it was really  really difficult for me to rub off any fingerprint marks that had accumulated on my touch   they seem to smear but stay put with the effort you'd normally have to use to remove marks without the cover on   so you need to put quite a bit of effort into it   i ended up removing the cover after only one day's use       i'm glad to hear that this product has met other people's expectations but it didn't meet mine
no other case will protect your phone such as this one  every other case that i have used as led to a broken screen or damaged part  this is by far the best product to protect your phone  i don't even think its that bulky
it was not a clear back instead it was all hot pink which i still liked  that's why i gave three stars  did come with screen protector
if your looking for a portable battery charger go to walmart or something like that  try something with a name brand  or something that's not from china  this product is made cheap  plus when i sent one back  i didn't even get credited for the full amount  they don't charge your cell phone battery  they just kill it  have tried 3  all do same thing  have tried 7 different smart phones  and 3 basic phones  and still decharges battery  on mine  my family  and friends  not happy
terrible charger  it worked for about a week and then i got the message that says it is not compatible with my phone  total waste of money  i can't see how this would make a difference but it worked just fine when i first got it and was using it in my own car  like i said for about a week   then i went on a trip with some friends and brought it along  where it also worked fine  however  upon plugging it back into my car is when i got the message saying it was no longer compatible with my phone  i don't see how switching cars would have made any difference  probably just a coincidence but either way  it no longer works  even if that was the reason i would expect a phone charger to work in more ports than just one  ridiculous
i dont think this was an oem replacement   the item stopped working as soon as it was placed into the device
the fit is ok  a bit cumbersome with glasses the sound quality is very nice the bluetooth fetcher is great but the leia look    so not fitting for public usage
i can charge from nearly dead the following 1 samsung galaxy note 31 samsung galaxy note 10 1  2014 ed 1 nexus 7  2013 ed 1 ps vita  the vita even recognizes it as a charger with the cool graphic 1 nvidia shieldall simultaneously i've now got 3 of them  one at the bedside  one in my living room and one for travel on the road
i have used this everyday for nearly two months  it has worked flawlessly i would have given 5 stars if the clip was a bit more durable  the volume slider were not so finicky touchy  and the sound didn't distort at loud max volume there are many reviews here already  so i won't elaborate on every detail  but here is my short take pros  excellent sound quality    85  volume   85  distorts a little  long rechargeable battery life  estimate 10 hours  i pair with my windows 8 tabletacer iconia w700 6465 11 6 inch 128 gb tablet  silver and my windows 8 phonenokia lumia 920 4g windows phone  black  at t  at the same time   this allows me to stream hulu netflix songza while still answering phone calls and text messages  with voice dictation    while listening to tablet  the headset switches to phone to announce voice caller id or read text message     i then have ability to use the built in microphone to speak on phone or dictate commands to phone  to dictate text reply      after phone call or text dictation  the headset automatically switches back to play source to resume playback     pair to both by first holding the play button and sliding the volume to choose play source  computer tablet      then pair microphone headset function to phone by holding the phone button and sliding volume to choose headset source displays song info on screen compatible with any headphones  i prefer thejvc hafxc80 black series in ear carbon headphones  very light clip to attach to clothes or bagcons  clip is not durable in rough environments as it has broken off of unit once  luckily i found the v shaped coil spring and was able to put it back together  sound seems to distort a little if you max the touch volume slider while inputting a high volume bt signal volume slider is touch based and is a bit finicky touchy  next iteration sony should use buttons like the rest of the controls i love this product and recommend it highly
bought this one for my iphone  kind of ok product don't know why i bought this one    i don't use it much
i have bought two of these cases so far because i love them   one in this color and the other in pink   i really love the cases   this coral blue color is so fun and rare   it reminds me of summer   it is very slim on my phone   i am able to sit my phone in my docking station without removing the case  which is rare for the cases i have found    i have dropped it and the case has held up fine   it does show some minor paint chips on the corners from me dropping it  but nothing actually broke   the cases is extremely hard to get off the phone though   if you like to switch out your phone covers all of the time  this one might not be for you   otherwise   i give it two thumbs up
i really like d  this item  it fits my wife's galaxy sii  with case  and it worked well for the first few months   as with other reviews mine  i bought 2  have become loose and the phone sags down  bad for driving augmentation apps    i have yet to try the microfiber cloth fix mentioned in other reviews  richard
there isn't to much to review for this it seemed to work just fine there haven't been any issues with the product
easy to install  great protection from otterbox like no other case can provide  i would recommend this to anyone who needs the ultimate protection for cell phone  i was tempted to buy a bulk item but didn't after reading reviews  go with this one
i ordered this because it keeps the cable safe without twisting  it works great  some cables i have gotten for my fire hd and my fire before that were not good at charging  i attach this to my supercharger plug and it works quickly and efficiently  my girlfriend got a fire hd and i had her order one and an extra one for me to take with me  one at home  one in the case with the kindle  great product  good materials and very good price
